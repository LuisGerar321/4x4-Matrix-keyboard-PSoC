# Matrix-keyboard-PSoC-5lp

## Brief description
This PSoC 5 library allows you to read the matrix keyboard reading just digits ('1', 'A', etc) or a combination of digits  ('1997', 'A10B')

This library is a summary function to read a simple Matrix Keyboard 4x4. This allows you to create your PSoC projects without taking care of the low programming logic of reading the buttons of the keyboard.

On the other hand, you will able to put the focus on your project which is the important thing, and save a little time. This code is not a professional PSoC library because I wrote that while I was doing a scholar project so,
if you have other contributions or ideas for these functions,  you are free to extend that and send me a message to update this repository.
