# Matrix-keyboard-PSoC-5lp
This PSoC 5 library allows you to read the matrix keyboard reading just digits ('1', 'A', etc) or a combination of digits  ('1997', 'A10B')

This library is a serie of functions collection to read a simple Matrix Keyboard 4x4. This allows you creating your PSoC projects without taking care about the low logic of reading
the keyboard. In another hand, you just need you take care in programming your project and save time. This code is not a professional library, I wrote that to a schoolar project so,
if you have another contributions or ideas you are free to extend the library and send me a message to update that.
